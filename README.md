# Post-PLI Structural Reorientation in India’s Export Basket (2019–2024)

## Project Overview

This project evaluates early structural shifts in India’s export composition following the introduction of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. The analysis focuses on commodity-level export data to examine growth trends, export share changes, and concentration patterns.

The objective is to assess whether PLI-linked sectors demonstrate directional structural momentum consistent with policy intent.

## Data Source

Data used in this analysis is sourced from:

RBI Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy

## Sectors Analysed (PLI-Linked)

- Electronic Goods  
- Drugs & Pharmaceuticals  
- Engineering Goods  
- Organic & Inorganic Chemicals  
- Plastic & Linoleum  

---

## Methodology

The following analytical techniques were applied:

1. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  
2. Sectoral Export Share Analysis  
3. Petroleum-Adjusted Export Share Analysis  
4. Export Concentration Index (Herfindahl–Hirschman Index)

The analysis focuses on directional evidence rather than establishing causal attribution.

## Key Findings

- Electronic Goods recorded a CAGR of 31.59% (2019–2024).
- PLI-linked sectors increased export share from 44% (2019) to 51% (2024).
- The upward trend persists even after excluding petroleum exports.
- Export concentration remains stable, indicating diversification rather than excessive dependency.

## Limitations

- Short post-policy time horizon
- No firm-level data
- No econometric controls for global macroeconomic factors

The findings should be interpreted as early structural indicators.
